I called this project "WHERE ARE YOU"

1. CLIENT:
      My android application (WhereAreYou) which periodically (if active) sends current location to server in following format
      1X-41.1233X73.1233
      which is (ID#LATITUDE#LONGITUDE where #=X)
      
2. SERVER:
      The server (servlet) receives  the POST from client, parameters from POST is then written into MySQL (with timestamp)
      Every call from CLIENT updates the entry of latitude and longitude.

3. DISPLAY ON GOOGLE MAP:
      A. ON FOLLOWING CLIENT (ANDROID)
         <img src="../images/WHERE_ARE_YOU.png">
      Google Maps Android API is used (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/?hl=en_US)
      
      B. FOR HTML DISPLAY
      Google Maps JavaScript API is used
      
      On both the above cases, you would need to create an API Key (for each kind of access). For basic minimal uses, it will be free :)
      
      For my case, I used a call to my SERVER to get coordinates. That coordinate is then plotted to Google Map.
      
	  It is really a simple project. Next could be to
			 i.   Generalize it (for various users to create ID)
		      ii.  Package and Ship (client)
		     iii. Some cosmetic changes to the way it gets displayed
